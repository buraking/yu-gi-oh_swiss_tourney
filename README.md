## Introduction

This is a 48 hour hackathon project i made in collaboration with Marco Almeida (marcoafilho on github). The objective was to make a platform that allows users to join swiss-tournaments for Yu-Gi-Oh and create the deck you wanna use for the tournaments.



## Getting Started

The following instructions will give you a walkthrough to get the system up and running in no time.
Prerequisites

First, make sure that you have the right ruby version installed. It's recommended to use rvm or rbenv to manage your Ruby versions.

Install PostgreSQL as the database management system. Make sure that the right credentials are being used. They can be found at database.yml.

In order to compile the JavaScript files it is necessary to have Node.js installed. Like Ruby, opt for a solution that can manage different versions of node.
